First,Gushan introducedmproved measurements of ùúíùëêùêΩ‚Üíùõ¥+ùõ¥-‚àíand ùõ¥0ùõ¥0 decays.Next,Gushan answered some questions.

Yuhang:In TABLE II,the theoretical value is far from the measured value in œác0->Œ£+Œ£- channel. In summary Ôºåit also sayÔºö‚ÄúThe results for œác0 ->Œ£+Œ£- and œác0 ->Œ£0Œ£0 are still inconsistent with the prediction.‚Äù What caused this resultÔºü
Answer:ùúíùëê0 ‚Üí Œ£Œ£‡¥§ is supposed to be highly suppressed by the helicity selection rule. However, J. Phys. G 38, 035007 (2011) results indicate that the transitions via these kinds of loops as longdistance effects can give significant contributions. 

Amit:Can you please explain what is Helicity Selection Rule with a suitable example? 
Answer:Briefly introduce it.

Ryuta:In the Fig.4 (left), the invariant mass of Sigma+/Sigma-, I could find a small bump-like structure around 3.36-3.37 GeV. If I check that for the case of Sigma+/Pbar/K0short, as you have shown last week, there also would be a similar structure on this region.
Answer:No discussion on this.

Xin:Could you briefly explain what is the ‚Äúcolor octet mechanism (OCM)‚Äù ? Probably
with Feynman diagram ‚Ä¶
Answer:It‚Äôs a model in the Non-relativistic Quantum ChromodynamicsÔºå(NRQCD), it is used to deal with the decay of the colored heavy quarkantiquark pairs on the short and long distance scale problem.

Yuzhen:In Fig.3 (left), the density of black point in the center is highest, but density of up, underneath, left and right side of the center is a little higher than other places, why? 
Answer:1, He has selected the clean Œõ signals.
       2,The width of Œõ is very narrow.

Suyu:In right panel of figure 1, what's the rule to select such the boxes as background? As I remember, you did some similar thing in your analysis. Why some box contributes as 1/4 while others 1/2? 

Kai:section V, the PDF of signal peaks including a Gaussian function, why the mean value is set to be zero?
Anwser:Actually, if we didn‚Äôt set it to be zero, the mean of the shape will shift because of the convolution. Usually we will set it too. otherwise it will give a very small change interval

Next,Liukai introduced Introduction to technical documentation.  Finally, Yuhang introduced the motivation about next JC paper.
