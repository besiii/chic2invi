From this week on, we change our meeting from 9 a.m. at B324 to 12 p.m. at B424 in Fridays, so that we can have Kai to 
join the JC and have more discussion. And the new indico page has been created as above. 


This week, Kai introduced a paper "Search for invisible decays of omega and phi with J/psi data at BESIII", giving upper 
limits for the 2 channel. And a way to deal with same final states is introduced. 5th reference showed many theoritical 
prediction to invisible, including chi_c0 and eta_c, which is very helpful for our chic analysis. 


Because of Maoqiang's absence, Suyu introduced the special topic prepared by Maoqiang as his agent, "Direct measurement 
of the branching fractions for K0 and K*0 production in J/psi decays". But we don't understand what's the meaning of 
blue words. Did Maoqiang do some analysis similar to this one? And too many details are shown in slides, so maybe it's 
not a good idea to let someone else be as agent.
