Ryuta Kiuchi gave a introduction on "Development of monolithic pixel detector with SOI technology for the ILC vertex 
detector". 


Qï¼š For the requirements for ILC vertex detector, time resolution to identify a single bunch crossing every 554ns for 
1300 bunches. Is 554ns the time interval of train or bunch? 
A: Bunch.


Q: Is the S/N to every pixel or cluster?
A: Pixel. Pixel with S/N > 64 as a seed.



Then Suyu Xiao gave a brief introduction on "Search for the decay J/psi->gam+invisible". 


Q: This work is done on CLEO-c. So they have single gamma trigger?
A: They didnot choose events by single gamma, but pi+pi-gam.


Q: Can we give a upper limit distribution for J/psi->invisible?
A: I don't think we can. Because energy of invisible in this case is in a range(energy of gam is in a range), for our 
J/psi->invisible, the invariant mass of invisible is a certain value. We can only give a value for upper limit. 
But for Chic's case, maybe we can try to give an upper limit distribution.
