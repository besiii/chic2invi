Today Lingteng introduced a paper about muon detector. Tao had his graduation thesis rehearsal. And 3 under-graduates(Ma Rui, 
Guo Xin, Ling Pan) introduced briefly their work during this week on machine learning.



1. Oscillations from electron to muon neutrinos give rise to easily detectable “wrong-sign” muons, that is, 
muons whose sign is opposite to that of the stored muon beam. How does this reaction happen?


By detecting the final state particles, we can easily distinguish where the neutrino come from.

 

2. Why do they call it JadePix?


There's an old saying in Chinese culture: The finest jade must be cut. The CMOS divice need to be optimized in 
near future, so we call it JadePix.

 

3. Is decision tree for supervised-learning or unsupervised-learning?


For supervised-learning.
