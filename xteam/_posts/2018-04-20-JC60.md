An introduction about the history of accelerator is given by Lingteng. 

  Ryuta: Is muon detector designed to be a linear detector in future?
  Lingteng: Not a linear detector, but a circular detector. Because the lifetime of muon can be longer 
due to the relativistic effect.



And Hao introduces TCT measurements on vertex detector, leaving a discussion to be answered.

  A comment from Ryuta: Because of the fluctuation in time, we usually wait 3 hours to measure.

  Considering the energy of infra-red and red laser is really low, why do they use these two to study?
And lower energy beam can only produce few electron-hole pairs, reaching longer distence in material.
High energy beam such as violet laser can produce much more electron-hole pairs, stucking on the surface.
If so, photons with high energy cannot go through the vertex detector.
But in reality, we do want the photons with high energy can produce some information in EMC.
So maybe I misunderstand something.
