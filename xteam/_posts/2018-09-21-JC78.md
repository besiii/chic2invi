First,Yuhang introduced Cross section and Higgs mass measurement with Higgsstrahlung at the CEPC. He answered some questions from others.

Suyu:Whatâ€™s Higgsstrahlung ?
Yuhang:Higgsstrahlung is the process about e+e-->ZH.

Ryuta:What's the cuts effect and meaning.
Yuhang:The cuts which suppress the 2 fermion backgrounds is coming from the total momentum is zero and two moun's angle are about 180 degree.

Xin:Why is impossible for the LHC to access the Higgs total width or absolute couplings in a model-independent way?
Yuhang:Precision tests of higgs boson couplings to one-percent will require complementary precision programs. Because the model is depandant, the precision cannot be trusted. Absolute couplings and in a model-independent way.
Xin:The reason of impossible may be that we cann't mearsure all branches ratio about higgs decay. So we don't know the total width.

Next,Ryuta gave a brief introduction about next JC topic.
