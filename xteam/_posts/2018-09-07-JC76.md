First,Kai introduced observation of the decay D0→K-π+e+e-, and answered Gu's question about FCNC.Below are detailed questions and answers. 
Xin's question:Does this veto those BSM predictions.

kai answered:uncertainties in theoretical predictions are large.The BSM predictions not been ruled out.

Suyu's question: why do they treat the uncertainty in branching fraction as a independent one?

kai answered:For the external uncertainty,the results could be update conviniently.

Finally,kai put forward his doubt about whethe this decay is a FCNC process.
Second,Ryuta introduced the Higgs couplings.He told what is Higgs coupling ,which precision on the measurement of the couplings,and How to measure the couplings.

Third,Xin maked a simple introduction about next JC paper.
