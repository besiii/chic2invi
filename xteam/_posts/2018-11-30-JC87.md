First,Yuhang introducedH→ e+e− at CEPC: ISR effect with MadGraph. The main content included CEPC basic information,Motivation,Signal and background,Cut condition,Calculate upper limit.Next, Yuhang answered some questions.

YuZhen:In Figure2, why does the curves decrease suddenly at about 250GeV?
Answer:The center of mass energy is 250GeV.

Amit:How will the MADGRAPH change the effect of ISR in this analysis?
Answer:MadGraph is a simulation method, and it can simulate e+e- ->ZH with ISR and without ISR respectively. I don’t know how to use MadGraph.

Ryuta:The ISR implementation in MadGraph is the title in section 2, but, could you briefly introduce the "Whizard" , "MadGraph" and their relationship ?
Answer:MadGraph5_aMC@NLO is a framework that aims at providing all the elements necessary for SM and BSM phenomenology, such as the computations of cross sections, the
generation of hard events and their matching with event generators, and the use of a variety of tools relevant to event manipulation and analysis.-High precision simulation WHIZARD is a program system designed for the efficient calculation of multi-particle scattering cross sections and simulated event samples.

Xin:In the page5, it says “ the 95% confidence level upper limit on H −→ e+e− branch ratio can then be decided to be 0.024%.”, it looks the 0.024% is an
output value from the calculation. But why on page 6, Figure 4, in the caption, it says “assuming” the BR = 0.024%?
Suyu:It says that 'The 95% confidence level upper limit on H->ee can then be decided to be 0.024%.' Could you explain the process in which they get the result?
Answer:1.Get the distribution of 𝜇 which obey Gaussian. 2.Get the 95%CL upper limit of 𝜇. 3.Get the 95%CL upper limit of signal branch. 4.Use the 95%CL upper
limit of signal branch to fit ZH_inclusive.

Kai:Last line of page4, 50000 signal generated and final efficiency about 7%, this will give a yield about 3500, but only about 20 in Figure 4, what's the reason?
Answer:Generate 10^6 Higgs. BR(H->e+e-)=0.024%. The number of H->e+e- generated is 240. The efficiency of selecting is 7%. So the number left is 7%×240=17. 

Next,Yuzhen introduce What is plasma?. The main content contained Plasma,Plasma processing fundamentals: frequency and others,Low pressure gas plasma diagram
,Plasma cleaning in wedge bonding and March plasma systems. Finally, Liukai introduced the motivation about next JC paper.
