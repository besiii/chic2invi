Zeng Hao gave a special topic about Signal Development in Silicon Strip Sensors. Yang Tao kindly pointed out a mistake
in Hao's slides: E = -▽φ.


E_{w}=delta#phi_{w}(x,z) should be E_{w}=-delta#phi_{w}(x,z)


And Liu Kai present a presentation on Observation of hc Radiative Decay hc->gam+eta' and Evidence for hc->gam+eta.


Question from Suyu: 


1 #psi^{'}->#pi^{0}h_{c}
                 h_{c}->#gamma#eta^{'}
                              #eta^{'}->#pi^{+}#pi^{-}#eta
                                                      #eta->#gamma#gamma
2 #psi^{'}->#gamma#eta
                #eta->#gamma#gamma
                
How can we distinguish #eta in 1 and 2?
Answer:
Maybe we can apply a 4C or 5C fit.
Question from Kai:
Truly undersatnd the meaning of "evidence" and "observation"
Answer:
For evidence: 5#sigma or more than that
For observation: 3#sigma or more than that
