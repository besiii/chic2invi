A talk is given at BESIII Summer Collaboration Meeting on June 27 - July 1, 2018. 
It's a version without TDC cut(suggested by Professor Yuan at Charmonium Round-table Meeting on May 9, 2018). 
Several comments and suggestions are received. More details are recorded on OneNote June 29, 2018. 
And I've tried 2 suggestions to see whether background can be suppressed. 
Until now, no chi_c peaks appear.
