title: Jpsi invisible decay 
---

J/psi invisible analysis. 

An invisible particle decay mode is defined as one where the final particles 
interact so weakly that there are no observables in general purpose particle detectors. 
Invisible decays of quarkonia such as J/psi etc., and other mesons
provide a window on physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). This is because the 
only allowed invisible decay of quarkonium states in the SM is the decay to nunu
via annihilation into a virtual Z0 boson. If the invisible decay rate is observed
to have a larger branching fraction than the SM prediction, it implies physics
beyond the SM. Invisible decays of some other particles have be studied.

Using 14.0*10^6 Psip events, the BESII experiment obtained a first upper 
limit, B(J/psi->invisible)/B(J/psi->mu+mu-)<1.2*10^-2,
corresponding to B(J/psi->invisible)<7*10^-4 
via the Psip->pi+pi-J/psi transition. We present here updated results 
of search for the invisible decay of the J/psi. The data sample used consists of 
106.41+-0.86*10^6 Psip events collected with the BESIII detector
at the BEPCII collider.
