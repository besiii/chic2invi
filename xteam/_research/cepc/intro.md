## Introduction
 The CEPC is a circular positron-electron collider with its circumference of
100 km. The precise measurements of the Higgs boson properties will serve tests
of the standard model (SM) as well as the search for the beyond SM. The CEPC is
proposed to aiming for the Higgs studies with high luminosity
(current design value is 3x10^34/cm^2/s ). The accelerator complex consists of
a linear accelerator, a damping ring, the Booster and the Collider where the
two interaction points and the two RF system will be installed.
The center-of-mass energy at the interaction point is 240 GeV for a Higgs
factory, as well as 91 GeV for a Z factory and 160 GeV for a W factory.
