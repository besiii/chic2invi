title: ITk Phase II Upgrade
---

ATLAS is one of the four major experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It is a general-purpose particle physics experiment run by an international collaboration and is designed to exploit the full discovery potential and the huge range of physics opportunities that the LHC provides.
The upgrade of the central tracking system for the ATLAS experiment for the operation at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will start in the middle of 2026. At this time the LHC will have been upgraded to reach a peak instantaneous luminosity of 7.5×1034 cm−2s−1, which corresponds to approximately 200 inelastic proton-proton collisions per beam crossing. The new Inner Tracker (ITk) will be operational for more than ten years, during which ATLAS aims to accumulate a total data set of 3,000 fb−1. Meeting these requirements presents a unique challenge for the design of an all silicon tracking system that consists of a pixel detector at small radius close to the beam line and a large area strip tracking detector surrounding it. 
IHEP ATLAS group attendS the Inner Tracker Phase II Upgrade, especially the barrel silicone strip moudle production, planning to produce 1000 moudles, including hybrid assemble, module assemble, wire bonding and electric test etc.
